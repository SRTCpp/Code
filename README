SRTC++ (Barnes et al. 2018, Astronomical Journal) was designed on computer
systems running the FreeBSD operating system.  While I'm certain that it's
possible to get it to run on other architectures, like Linux, I don't know how
to do that.  But here are some hints based on our experience.

SRTC++ relies on the following dependencies:  Numerical Recipes, sqlplus,
cspice, cfitsio, QT3, gdal, ImageMagick++, openmp, c++ Boost

Numerical Recipes is not open-source software.  Due to licensing constraints,
please purchase access to NR at http://nr.com/ ($65 as of 2018 April).  Then
contact the author at jwbarnes@uidaho.edu or jason@barnesos.net and I will send
you copies of all NR dependencies and altered NR code for Jcube.

Johnathon Ahlers provided copies of Ubuntu Makefiles for both Jcube and a
program that depends on Jcube.  Those are included in the distribution as
"Makefile.Ubuntu" -- they are very unlikely to work without alteration, but
might serve as a useful starting point for different system architectures.
